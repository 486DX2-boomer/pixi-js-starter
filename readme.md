# Pixi JS Starter

This is my custom starter template for PixiJS projects.

First run `npm install`. The project will be ready to go with Typescript definitions enabled.

After that, `npm run dev` will run the Typescript compiler, build the project with ESBuild, and start a local server with `serve`. `npm run build` will compile and build the project, but forego running the web server.
